A game prototype made in Turbo Pascal, data codes says 2004 but I remember it to be older than that, maybe 2001 or 2002.

It runs in DOSbox

I programmed all the tools myself, I had a program to convert RAW files from photoshop into my .DAT files for the sprites. I don't remember how that worked really, but I created an "indexed image" in photoshop and generated a palette that I could save into .PAL files. I saved the RAW file, and then I had a program that combined the PAL with the RAW file into a DAT file.

There is a DAT file reader called DATRED.EXE

MAPEDIT.EXE has some bug that I cannot understand now, you where supposed to be able to changed between tiles with q and e, but nothing happens and it renders empty tiles. But you can look at the map with w,a,s,d controls. Control the little with box with the mouse.

Increase the cpu cycles in DOSbox so the game runs around 250FPS. Back then I had a 200MHz computer that ran the game smoothly, but I noticed that the game was running too fast when I later got a 800MHz Pentium III ;)
